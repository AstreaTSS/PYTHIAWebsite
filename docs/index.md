PYTHIA is a Discord bot meant to assist with various parts of running Danganronpa/Killing Game RPs. It plans to eventually serve as a replacement to Ultimate Assistant.

## Investigations

PYTHIA supports a unique system for discovering Truth Bullets, where by saying a specific phrase/trigger in a channel, a Truth Bullet gets triggered.

This servers to automate the usual flow for Truth Bullets in many KGs.
