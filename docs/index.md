> "Hello. I am PYTHIA, the Ultimate Robotic Assistant. I look forward to assisting you in whatever tasks you may have."

PYTHIA is a Discord bot meant to assist with various parts of running Danganronpa/Killing Game RPs. The various features can be seen below.

## BDA Investigations

PYTHIA supports a unique system for discovering Truth Bullets, where by saying a specific phrase/trigger in a channel, a Truth Bullet gets triggered.

This servers to automate the usual flow for Truth Bullets in many KGs.
