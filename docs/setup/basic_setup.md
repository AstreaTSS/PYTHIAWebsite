description: How to set up PYTHIA for your roleplay server.

# Basic Setup

Setting up PYTHIA is a simple affair. Let's break it down by steps:

### Invite the Bot

This is the simplest step. Simply use [this invite link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=843994199187914753&permissions=532576332864&scope=bot%20applications.commands) or use the "Invite Bot" option to the side to do so.

### Setting Up the Config

It's worth running `/config info` first when you set up the bot. This gives you a pretty good idea about what options there are to use for the configuration (admittedly, not many):

Your priority should be _setting up the player role._ This can be done pretty easily: select the `/config player` command, _use the role option_, and use the role you wish to be able to be treated as players and discover Truth Bullets (or your RP's equivalent). It's worth noting that _no other role will be able to use them, not even admins._
