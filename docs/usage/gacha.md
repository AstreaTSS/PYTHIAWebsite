# Gacha

The gacha system is a fun way of getting items in your roleplay server. If the staff members in your server have set it up, here's how you can use it!

!!! note
    All user/player-facing gacha commands are stored in `/gacha`.

## Profile and Currency

Before drawing, you'll probably want to know how much coins/currency you have. To see that *and what items you've drawn*, you can use `/gacha profile`:

<figure markdown>
  ![An example of /gacha profile.](gacha_profile.png)
</figure>

Currency, of course, is your way of being able to roll in the gacha system. *Staff* will give you currency to use, usually depending on a number of situations in the game, so please refer to them for the ways you can gain currency.

## Rolling/Pulling/Drawing

The main event! To roll from the gacha, you can use `/gacha roll`. This will give you a random item from the gacha pool, and it'll be added to your gacha item inventory. Here's an example of what that looks like:

<figure markdown>
  ![An example of /gacha roll.](gacha_draw.png)
</figure>

!!! note "Aliases"
    You can also use `/gacha draw` or `/gacha pull` as aliases for `/gacha roll`.

Each roll costs a certain amount of currency (dependent on the staff - the bot will tell you how much each roll costs if you do not have enough), so be sure to check how much you have before you draw!

## Viewing an Item

Now, `/gacha profile`, as mentioned earlier, can be used to view all of your items. But if you want to see more information about a single item, you can use `/gacha view-item` and specify the name of the item you want to see. This will give you a more detailed view of the item, including its description, and image (if it has one).

<figure markdown>
  ![An example of /gacha view-item.](view_gacha_item_player.png)
</figure>

## Giving Currency To Another Player

Feeling generous? You can give currency to another player using `/gacha give-currency`. This will give the specified amount of currency to the mentioned user. Here's an example of how that looks:

## Notes

- Items are made by the staff of your server. PYTHIA does not take responsibility for the items in the gacha system.
- Each item has an equal chance of being rolled, at least for right now. You may or may not be able to draw items you already own - that's, once again, dependent on staff.
- As implied earlier, the staff decide if they wish to use the gacha at all. It's a good idea to defer to them for any questions about the gacha system in your server.
