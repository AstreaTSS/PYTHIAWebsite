# Rebrand to PYTHIA!

Hello! The rebrand from Ultimate Investigator to **PYTHIA** is here! This means a new name and icon, an increased scope, and a bunch of renamings.

<!-- more -->

!!! note
    If you see this, the renaming is mostly completely, but the bot's name on Discord is still Ultimate Investigator. This will be fixed soon!

    More importantly, the renamings are the same as the ones mentioned in the previous post - check that out [right here](062524-rebrand-soon.md).

## New Look

In case you're wondering about the new look... well, I'm sure you've already seen it around this website. But here's a reminder!

The idea was to keep a somewhat similar look to the old one, but with PYTHIA instead of a generic search icon. I hope you like it!

## New Features

As promised, there are a lot of new features. We'll break this down into two sections.

### Investigations

- `/bullet-config names` now exists! This command allows you to edit the display name for Truth Bullets and the like for public-facing messages and commands. This is useful for when you want to have a different name for a Truth Bullet than the actual trigger.
- `/bullet-config manual-trigger` also exists, allowing you to trigger a Truth Bullet yourself. Useful if your players get stuck!

### Gacha!

Gacha is here! This system is entirely staff-controlled, allowing as much flexibility as needed. Users can spend currency to get items, and the system is entirely customizable.

Of course, there's new guides to go along with this new feature. Check them out below!

## Privacy Policy/ToS Update

The privacy policy and the ToS have been updated to reflect the new name and icon, as well to note how new features are stored. You can view the updated documents here:
