# A Messaging System!

PYTHIA now supports a messaging system, where users can send messages to each other through the bot. This has all of the bells and whistles you'd expect from a messaging system, including the ability to send messages anonymously (if said feature is enabled enabled).

<!-- more -->

Here are some snippets of the messaging system in action:

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- ![An example of a messaging system configuration.](message_config.png)
- ![An example of /message-manage list-links.](message_list_links.png)
</div>

Of course, there's new guides to go along with this new feature. Check them out below!
