# New Dice System!

PYTHIA now supports a dice system, where users can roll and manage dice using standard notation in their roleplay server. Noticably, this system also allows staff to manage dice for users, which can be useful for roleplays where stat systems are used.

Here are some snippets of the dice system in action:

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- ![An example of using a registered dice](dice_roll_registered.png)
- ![An example of registering a die for a user.](dice_register_for.png)
- ![An example of a list of registered dice](dice_list.png)
</div>

Of course, there's new guides to go along with this new feature. Check them out below!
