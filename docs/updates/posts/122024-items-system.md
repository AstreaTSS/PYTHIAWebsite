# New Items System!

PYTHIA now supports an item system, where users can find, take, and manage items in their roleplay server. You can function this system as a simple item management system, or use it as a general-purpose investigation system, or more!

<!-- more -->

Here are some snippets of the items system in action:

<div class="grid cards" markdown>
- ![An example of creating an item.](create_item_modal.png)
- ![An example of a user viewing their inventory.](view_inventory.png)
- ![An example of finding an item.](items_here.png)
- ![An example of viewing placed items.](list_placed_items.png)
</div>

As usual, there's new guides to go along with this new feature. Check them out below!
- [Items as a User](items.md)
- [Setting Up Items](items_setup.md)
