## What Data We Collect

We collect data with different scenarios, each scenario covered by this Policy will be explained below.

#### Collected by Command

The following data may be collected and temporarily stored when intentionally provided by a User via usage of a function of the Bot, hence this data is not collected automatically. Should a User provide data in this manner, they forego any rights pertaining to the content of the data provided.

-   Server specific configuration settings.
-   Information about Truth Bullets, including the content of the Truth Bullet, the channel it is meant to be sent in, the keyword/phrase that triggers it, and the triggering user.

#### Automatically Collected

This data may be collected automatically by some Services. This data is used to facilitate critical functionality of Services, and are vital to its operation.

-   Any data needed for standard operation of the Bot. This typically includes channel data and roles.
  -   Notably, this includes messages and message content, but only in the context of the Bot's operation. This data is quickly processed and is not permanently stored.

## Why We Collect Data

We collect data to facilitate functions of Services, and to provide us with analytical data about the Bot's usage and behavioral patterns.

## Who We Share Data With

We do not share data with any 3rd party for any reason whatsoever, unless required by law.

## How Your Data is Stored

All data is stored on protected infrastructure. While storage methods may vary between Services, most data will be stored within enterprise-standard databases such as [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/). Please keep in mind that even with the highest standard of protection, no data can ever be 100% secure. While we strive to keep data secure and private at all times, absolute security cannot be guaranteed.

## How Long Your Data is Retained

Data collected via command, meaning collected via explicit understanding that the data is going to be saved (cache), is retained for as long as the instance of the Bot runs or until it is cleared to make room. Other data retained is as follows:

#### Server Configuration

The Bot stores information relating to a Server's configuration. This information is automatically deleted if it leaves a Server, but is otherwise indefinitely kept.

#### Truth Bullets

The Bot stores information about Truth Bullets, including the content of the Truth Bullet, the channel it is meant to be sent in, the keyword/phrase that triggers it, and the triggering user. This information is automatically deleted if the Bot leaves a Server, but is otherwise indefinitely kept until a Server Manager deletes them through the Bot.

## Your Rights to Your Data

Pursuant to various jurisdictions, you have the right to request a machine-readable copy of your data for portability's sake and the right to have your data deleted from the Service.

Should you wish to enforce one of these rights, please send an email to [discord@astrea.cc](mailto:discord@astrea.cc) - we will strive to respond to your request within 30 days.
